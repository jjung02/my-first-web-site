  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"
    target="_blank" title="CSS specification"><strong>Cascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u></strong></a>
    is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
    such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology
    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
    of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
    CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
    .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
